# Gillespie C++

This is repository contains a C++ version of the Gillespie algorithm. 
This should address some disadvantages of the python version. 

PROS (hopefully): 
+ Speed 
+ Memory footprint 
+ Organization 
+ Can be exposed to Python, R, etc. (currently only exported to Python 3.x)

CONS: 
- C++ demands more in-depth knowledge and some level of memory management.
